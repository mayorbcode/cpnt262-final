## Objectives
&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to deploy a multi-page, database-driven Product website using Express, EJS and Mongoose. It will be deployed to Heroku and MondoDB Atlas.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to go with a travel website theme as we offer our tour guide services at various tourist locations across the globe.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The website consists of;
1. A home Page
2. A gallery which displays images of our various service locations
3. A gallery-item page which gives a brief insight as to what to expect from the selected location
4. A team page which displays our management team members
5. A subscribe page where potential clients can leave their information where they will be contacted
6. An admin page which shows a list of our subscribers
